# Solutions

This repository contains my programming solutions organized by platform and problem source. Each file name matches the original problem title or identifier for quick lookup.

## Structure

- **Codeforce/** — Solutions to Codeforces problems.
- **GeekforGeek/** — Solutions to GeeksforGeeks problems.
- **HackerRank/** — Solutions to HackerRank problems.

## How to run

Most solutions are written in Python. To run any solution locally:

1. Open a terminal in the repository root.
2. Execute the script with Python, for example:

	python Codeforce/A_A_B.py

If a problem expects input, provide it via standard input as required by the original statement.

## Notes

- Files are named to mirror problem titles for easy search.
- Solutions focus on clarity and correctness; some may include optimized approaches where needed.
